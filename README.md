# Radiomics-analysis


## Contents 
Feature extraction and related processes were implemented with reference to the PyRadiomics library (https://pyradiomics.readthedocs.io/), which provides a robust framework for radiomic feature computation from medical images.

## Requirements
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox

## Acknowledgments
This project uses LASSO feature selection and modeling based on the implementation from the GitHub repository [Regression/Multi-variate LASSO regression with CV.ipynb]
